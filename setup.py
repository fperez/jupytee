# A minimal setup.py file to make a Python project installable.

# Note that while we are following modern packaging practices
# with setuptools metadata being declaratively stored in setup.cfg
# and build configuration listed in pyproj.toml, pip/setuptools
# as of this writing (early 2022) still require a minimal setup.py
# file in order to support editable development installs (pip install -e .)
