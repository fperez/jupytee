# jupytee - magics for using GPT-like models inside Jupyter

A small, experimental playground with Jupyter magics to use OpenAI's GPT-3 models inside Jupyter environments.

This isn't even alpha software - it's just a quick and dirty prototype.  But it works, if you have the python `openai` package installed and the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` defined with your personal API key as [per the docs](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

In a day or two I'll clean this up a bit with a proper env file, binder link, etc. It will stil be just a little toy playground for experimenting with the UX of connecting to a GPT-like engine, but at least a bit more tidy than now.

Yes, the name is a silly play on the pronunciation of GPT and Jupyter.
